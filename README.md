# Magic-Copy
Copy hitsound for Osu!Mania


**IMPORTANT**

1. Always copy from HS difficulty as source.
2. Do not use Storyboard samples in HS difficulty, make it as 9 keys if you need a lot of different HS at same time
3. Only put HS related things in HS difficulty.

__Guidelines__

1. It's okay to leave a lane empty in HS difficulty
2. Do not stack CFW in HS diff, its not good for reading.
3. Try to copy paste as much as you can if the sounds are same and repeated.
4. Use 1 sound for 1 column, you can use 1 sound in 2 columns if it's different volume. 
5. Use only 1 sampleset, use rest as custom named hitsound.
6. Use an audible hitnormal sample thats not blended with the song
7. W = kick, C = snare, F = hihat or cymbal, hitnormal = closed hat or soft bell, rest are named ones
